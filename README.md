# Finite-State-Automata-Machine-Generator-in-Python
This Python project reads a txt file containing the specifics required to build a finite state machine, the program then builds a fully functional finite state machine that is able to process input strings. After the strings have been processed the user is then presented a graphic of the FSA.
